# AI-Assisted Knowledge Quiz

A modern, interactive quiz application powered by AI that generates personalized questions and feedback across multiple topics.

## üöÄ Project Setup & Demo

### Web Application
```bash
# Quick setup (recommended)
npm run setup

# Or manual setup:
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key

# Start development server
npm start

# Build for production
npm run build
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Environment Setup
1. Copy `env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```
2. Get your free Groq API key from [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/keys)
3. Edit the `.env` file and replace `your_groq_api_key_here` with your actual API key:
   ```
   REACT_APP_GROQ_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   REACT_APP_GROQ_MODEL=llama-3.1-8b-instant
   ```

**Note**: Without an API key, the app will use fallback questions for demonstration purposes. Groq offers a generous free tier with fast inference!

### AI Features

## üìã Problem Understanding

This application addresses the need for an engaging, AI-powered quiz experience that:

1. **Generates Dynamic Content**: Uses AI to create quiz questions and personalized feedback
2. **Provides Smooth UX**: Features intuitive navigation, progress tracking, and responsive design
3. **Ensures Consistency**: Maintains reliable JSON output from AI prompts with proper error handling
4. **Offers Multiple Topics**: Covers diverse subjects including Wellness, Tech Trends, History, and Science

### Assumptions Made
- Users prefer immediate feedback with explanations
- Mobile-first responsive design is essential
- AI service should gracefully handle failures with fallback content
- Dark mode support enhances user experience

## ü§ñ AI Prompts & Iterations

### Initial Prompt Design
```
Generate 5 unique, educational multiple choice questions about {topic}. 

Requirements:
- Questions should be engaging and test real knowledge
- Each question should have exactly 4 options (A, B, C, D)
- Include a brief explanation for the correct answer
- Vary the difficulty level (mix of easy, medium, and challenging)
- Make questions current and relevant
- Ensure correctAnswer is the index (0-3) of the correct option

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with this exact structure:
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "question": "Your question here?",
      "options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Brief explanation of why this is correct"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Issues Faced & Refinements

1. **Inconsistent JSON Structure**
   - **Problem**: AI sometimes returned malformed JSON
   - **Solution**: Added comprehensive error handling and fallback to mock data
   - **Refined Prompt**: Added explicit structure requirements and validation

2. **Generic Feedback**
   - **Problem**: Initial feedback was too generic
   - **Solution**: Enhanced prompt to include score context and motivational elements
   - **Refined Prompt**: Added specific instructions for encouraging, constructive feedback

3. **Question Quality**
   - **Problem**: Some questions were too easy or poorly formatted
   - **Solution**: Added temperature control and more specific instructions
   - **Refined Prompt**: Specified educational value and difficulty requirements

### Final Optimized Prompts

**Quiz Generation:**
```
Generate 5 educational multiple choice questions about ${topic}. 
Questions should be:
- Educational and informative
- Well-formatted with clear options
- Appropriate difficulty level
- Include brief explanations

Return valid JSON with exact structure specified.
```

**Feedback Generation:**
```
Generate personalized feedback for quiz result:
Score: ${score}/${totalQuestions} (${percentage}%)
Topic: ${topic}

Provide encouraging, constructive feedback that:
1. Acknowledges performance level
2. Offers specific improvement advice
3. Motivates continued learning
4. Is 2-3 sentences long
```
